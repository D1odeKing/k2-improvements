# BED MESH

## Why

The K2 bed flexes quite a lot between ambient (cold) and heat soaked at the desired printing temperature.  So, it is best to take a bed mesh at your desired printing temperature.  However, the K2 also flexes quite a lot when you print the second or third object (even between the same print, K2 needs correction in bed/machine tilt values!).

But doesn't the K2 already take a bed mesh?

Yes, but during calibration it creates a bed mesh, but this is done at ambient temps. I highly doubt anyone is printing at ambient temperatures. Additionally, it only stores a single "default" bed mesh that is overwritten every time you calibrate.

### `_CREATE_MESH` Macro

This macro is responsible for generating a bed mesh calibration profile. A bed mesh compensates for any unevenness on the print bed.

**Key Steps:**
 1. Accepts user-defined parameters like:
    - `BED_TEMP` (default: 60°C)
    - `CHAMBER_TEMP` (default: 0°C)
    - `SOAK_TIME` (default: 5 minutes)
 2. Automatically homes axes if needed and warms up the extruder and bed.
 3. Supports heating soaking, leveling, and Z recalibration steps before creating a mesh.

### `MESH_IF_NEEDED` Macro

This macro ensures that the printer generates a new mesh if needed, or falls back on existing profiles:
 - Profile chosen by temperature chamber values.
 - Additional conditions given in property-check profile reaction logic backups, e.g.  `printer.scanner concepts` and runtime state handling debug resolver.!
